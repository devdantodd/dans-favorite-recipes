    <h1>PREPARATION</h1>
    STEP 1
    <ol>
    <li>Directions for patties:
    
        <li>Mix crab, egg, breadcrumbs, mayonnaise, chives, mustard, lemon juice, celery seed, onion powder, pepper and hot sauce in a large bowl. Form into 6 patties.
    
            <li>Heat oil and butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until the butter stops foaming. Cook the patties until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side.
    
                <li>Directions for onion rings:
    
                    <li>Place the onions, eggs, and flour into separate shallow bowls.
    
                        <li>In another shallow bowl, stir together the bread crumbs, salt, pepper, cayenne, oregano, basil, and red pepper.
    
                            <li>Heat oil in a heavy skillet or deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). Dip rings of onion into flour, then into the egg, and then into the bread crumb mixture, shaking off any excess after each dip.
    
                                <li>Carefully drop each onion ring into the hot oil, and fry for about 30 seconds on each side, or until golden. Remove from hot oil to paper towels to drain.
