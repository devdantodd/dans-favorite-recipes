<h1>Directions</h1>
<ol>

<li>
Cook lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling water for 10 minutes, or until al dente. Rinse with cold water, and drain.

<li>
Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add mushrooms, green peppers, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in pasta sauce and basil; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes.

<li>
While the sauce is simmering, mix together ricotta, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, and eggs in a medium bowl.

<li>
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.

<li>
Spread 1 cup cooked tomato and vegetable sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Lay down 1/2 of the lasagna noodles and layer 1/2 each of the ricotta mix, sauce, and Parmesan cheese on top. Repeat layering again with noodles, ricotta mix, sauce, and Parmesan cheese. Top with remaining 2 cups mozzarella.


<li>Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, for 40 minutes. Let stand for 15 minutes before serving.
